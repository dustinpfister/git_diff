# Fist post

This is the first post of a new website on git and many other topics of interest that involve source control, and many other such things that revolve around git such as programing and javaScript. This is just a silly demo post in a demo post folder. However what I am working out might be applied to some real deal folders that contain real content that might be of interest to some people.

## edit

This is some additional text that I have added to this post after the commit where I have first added this to the \_posts folder collection.
